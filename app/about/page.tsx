              I'm a full-stack developer who has been passionate about
              technology for over 12 years, with the last 3-4 years focused on
              professional development. My journey began with Linux, and I've
              been a dedicated Linux user ever since, appreciating its power,
              flexibility, and the philosophy of open-source software.
            </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              While I'm technically a fresher in terms of professional
              experience, I've spent years honing my skills, contributing to
              open-source projects, and building applications that solve real
              problems. I have a strong foundation in web development
              technologies and a growing expertise in system-level programming.
            </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              I'm particularly drawn to Go and Rust for their performance
              characteristics and elegant approaches to system programming. I
              believe in writing clean, well-documented code that not only works
              but is maintainable and scalable. Performance optimization and
              creating efficient solutions are aspects of development that I
              find especially rewarding.
